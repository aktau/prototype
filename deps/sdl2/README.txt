Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed
to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL and DirectX. It is used by video playback software,
emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog
and many Humble Bundle games.

The current version supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android.
The code contains support for other operating systems but those are not
officially supported.

SDL is written in C, but works with C++ natively, and has bindings to
several other languages, including C#, Python and more in progress.

This library is distributed under the zlib license, which can be found
in the file "COPYING.txt".

The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
